[BERT Task 1.txt](https://github.com/UOFA-INTRO-NLP-F21/f2021-proj-arif-shahriar-anik/files/7681371/BERT.Task.1.txt)
Briefly describe what is in each file.

▫️501Project_FinalTASK1.txt --> Contains the macro F1-scores on the Validation and Test sets for the 3 classifiers which are SVM, LR and Multinomial NB.\
▫️501Project_FinalTASK2.txt --> Contains the macro F1-scores on the Validation and Test sets for all the 4 models which are SVM, LR, Multinomial NB and Ensemble, along with the accuracies of just SVM and LR on the Validation set.\
▫️BERT Task 1.txt --> Contains  the trained model structure and training accuracy value after 1 epoch. Moreover, it contains loss and accuracy value reported on test set. In the last line, it contains the final macro F1-score on test set.
